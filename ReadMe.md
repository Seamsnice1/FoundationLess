I Love Zurb's Foundation framework, and wanted to combine it with a few other tools to make it even faster to prototype a site.

- Added in most of Andy Clarke's ["320 & Up" boilerplate](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/). Of particular interest is the global colour palette, which allows the whole colour scheme to be changed with one variable.
read [AC's blog on Less.css](http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/less), [Colour Palettes](http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/creating_colour_palettes)
- Added in the Text em calculator he has so text-size("x") outputs both px and em units
